          <h3>Maths</h3>
          <p>Maths is a subject which is not only applicable in our academics but also in real life. Making kids love this subject is a challenge, especially for parents. It takes a lot of brainpower to master Maths and this can be tough for kids. Some students may find Maths hard to learn. Thus, we presents here a simple and easy way for kids and higher class students to learn Maths, interestingly. The Maths basics here, becomes the solver to solve fundamental arithmetic calculations.</p>
          <p>We have provided Maths learning materials for all the standards (Standard 1 to 12). Also, Maths questions with solutions are given for each concept to help the students understand better. Practice Maths here with the given examples and practice questions for all the Classes from 1 to 12. For better practice, worksheets are also provided by us, so that students can excel in the concepts.</p>
          <p>In mapping Maths, we will come across many concepts. The origin or base of Maths is Counting, where we learned to count the objects that are visible to our eye. Mathematics are broadly classified into two groups: Pure Mathematics (number system, geometry, matrix, algebra, combinatorics, topology, calculus) and Applied Mathematics (Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, numerical analysis, etc).</p>
          <p>Maths has a lot of formulas based on different concepts. These formulas can be memorized by practising questions based on them. Some problems can be solved quickly, using Maths tricks. Class 1 to 10 has been taught with the general mathematical concepts, but its level increases in Class 11 and 12.</p>
          <p>We are providing learning materials for students of Class 6 to 12 based on the syllabus. In these classes, students set their foot into the world of all the important theories in Maths, like whole numbers, basic geometry, integers, decimals, algebra, ratio and proportion, etc. Since kids are more receptive to learning, when it is associated more with play than with work, hence it is a good idea for parents to expose kids to math in fun ways. We provide lessons for students till class 12, where they study the most complex topics like 3-D geometry, vector algebra, differential equations, matrices, etc.</p>
          <p>With the help of animations and innovative ways of teaching by our experts, the ideas and concepts are sure to stay etched in your minds forever. The purpose is to make math fun and help kids grow to understand that math is fun. Instead of being afraid, the kids will then be excited about the subject for the rest of their educational journey.</p>
