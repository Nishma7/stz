          <h3>Western Dance</h3>
          <p>
            Western dance encourages children to be more creative and to express themselves in many ways. By encouraging creativity and imagination, children learn to build trust, effective relationships, and how to think critically. Early childhood is the best period for the development of creativity, and creative problem solving will serve your child for life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In today’s technology-driven world, it is becoming increasingly important for children to adopt a physically active lifestyle early on. Dance is the perfect way to keep kids physically active in a fun way. By bringing your child to Dance Academy USA, they will improve their flexibility, range of motion, stamina and their strength. The movements in dance also help improve balance, coordination and posture. Dance focuses heavily on proper body alignment and learning how to move the body to create fluid motion. It’s no wonder dance has been used to help train athletes in some of today’s most competitive sports like football and basketball.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attending dance classes allows children to learn self-discipline and time management. As they get older, a dancer must learn how to balance school, dance, extracurricular activities, and social life. The dedication, discipline and focus children learn and practice in dance classes are important life skills that will transfer over to the school, work and other aspects of their lives.
