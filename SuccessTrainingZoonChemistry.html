          <h3>Chemistry</h3>
          <p>
            Our centre helps you to learn about the chemical elements, where they came from, and how they are arranged on the periodic table. Understand what we know about the structure of atoms, including the “paradox” that these tiny things that make up everything are apparently mostly nothing! Realize that the elements have more than one form… to charge or not to charge… that is the chemist’s question;)
          </p>
          <p>
            After learning some basic chemistry lessons about neutral atoms, you’ll learn about ions (charged, non-neutral atoms). They like to stick to water molecules like little tiny magnets. This explains a lot about acids and bases. You’ll see demonstrations of acids and bases, learn the theory, work out problems, and (optionally) craft your own homemade pH testing kit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the basic chemistry lessons is to create strong foundations in the concepts of chemistry. And to show you that learning chemistry can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience free of anxiety and worry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The big ideas you’ll be learning:
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding what atoms and elements are<br>
Knowing the “big history” of the elements forming from the simplest elements to the biggest and most complex<br>
Recognizing the different forms of the elements<br>
Reading the Periodic Table, which isn’t just a list of things to memorize<br>
Building a mental model of atoms and atomic theory<br>
Getting the basic chemistry about acids and bases (pun intended)<br>
Seeing, doing, and experiencing hands-on chemistry
